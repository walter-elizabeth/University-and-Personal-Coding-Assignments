These are some assignments I did as part of SQL courses I took. All of them are in MySQL.

The notebooks titled "Exercise 11" and "Exercise 12" were part of the Duke University course Managing Big Data with MySQL. They were the last two assignments of the course, where we took all of the querying skills and methods we had learned in the course and applied them to data provided by a company called Dognition to answer some questions in the data. I cleared the ouptuts where there were a large number of rows in the output for viewing ease.
