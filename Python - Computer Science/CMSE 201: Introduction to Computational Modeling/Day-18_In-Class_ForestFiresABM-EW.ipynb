    "## Reviewing the motivation for the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why model forest fires?\n",
    "\n",
    "While this isn't a huge problem in Michigan, the states in the western United States having been suffering a tremendous problem with huge and difficult-to-control forest fires.  This comes from a combination of extended drought conditions, dense woodlands, and forest management policies that suppress small fires and thus ensure that large quantities of dead, dry trees and brush are available to burn when a large fire inevitably starts (typically from lighting strikes, but occasionally from negligent campers).  In recent years, this has been exacerbated by climate change, which has both caused drought conditions to be more severe and allowed tree-killing diseases and insects to flourish, which produces more dead, easily-burned wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "These forest fires destroy ecosystems and peoples' homes and other property, and can result in the loss of human and animal life.  A key challenge in forest management is to attempt to contain these huge forest fires once they start, in order to protect human lives, settlements, and infrastructure.  To that end, it is critical to have models of how fire spreads in various conditions; see, for example, the [Open Wildland Fire Modeling group](https://www.openwfm.org/wiki/Open_Wildland_Fire_Modeling_E_community_Wiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the type of model that we're going to create is an example of a \"percolation\" model, where one substance (in this case, fire) moves through another substance (in this case, forest).  This type of problem is interesting in a variety of fields, including geology (oil or water percolating through rock, sand, or soil), human behavior (crowd movement in amusement parks), and in physics (understanding how two materials mix together).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a \"tipping point\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model also demonstrates the concept of a \"critical threshold\" or a \"tipping point\".  This is a phenomenon that occurs when a small change in an input parameter results in a large change in outcome.  This is a phenomenon that shows up in both simple and complex models, and happens in such varied circumstances as forest fires, the spread of disease in populations, and the transfer of information within a population."

    "\n",
    "In this model, we'll create a two-dimensional square array with sides $N$ cells long that represents the forested region we're simulating.  **The cells in the array can have three values: 0 (empty), 1 (trees), and 2 (on fire).**  At the beginning of the model, a user-specified fraction of the cells $f_\\text{trees_start}$ (equivalent to the NetLogo `density` parameter) are randomly filled with trees, and the remaining cells are empty.  \n",
    "**One edge of the board (say, the entire leftmost column) is set on fire.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell has a \"neighborhood\" that is composed of its four neighbors to the left, right, above, and below it.  (Note: not the diagonal elements!)  If a cell is along one of the edges of the array, only consider the neighbors that it has, and don't try to go out of the bounds of the array!\n",
    "\n",
    "The model takes steps forward in time, where every cell is modified based on the previous step.  The model evolves as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the cell was empty last turn, it stays empty this turn.\n",
    "* If the cell is a tree and any of its neighbors were on fire last turn, it catches on fire.\n",
    "* If the cell was on fire last turn, the fire has consumed all of the trees and it is now empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model evolves forward in time until all of the fires have burned out.  After this happens, you can calculate the fraction of the cells that still have trees at the end of the model ($f_\\text{trees_end}$) and the fraction of cells that are empty ($f_\\text{empty}$).  The fraction of burned cells, $f_\\text{burned}$, is just the difference between the fraction of cells that were initially trees and the fraction of cells that are trees at the end of the model; in other words,\n",
